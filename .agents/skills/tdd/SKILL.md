# Test-Driven Development

TDD is the red → green loop. This skill is the reference that makes that loop produce tests worth keeping: what a good test is, where tests go, the anti-patterns, and the rules of the loop. Every section applies on every cycle — consult them before and during the loop, not after.

Use established project domain language and respect applicable ADRs. Consult `CONTEXT.md` only when relevant terminology is not already established.

## What a good test is

Tests verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't. A good test reads like a specification — "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists — and survives refactors because it doesn't care about internal structure.

See [tests.md](tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for mocking guidelines.

## Seams — where tests go

A **seam** is the public boundary you test at: the interface where you observe behavior without reaching inside. Tests live at seams, never against internals.

**Test only at pre-agreed seams.** A seam is pre-agreed when it is explicitly established by the ticket, spec, architecture, or current conversation.

Before writing a test, identify the seam under test. Ask the user to confirm it only when no pre-agreed seam exists or multiple plausible seams would materially change the test.

Never invent an unresolved seam merely to avoid asking.

## Anti-patterns

* **Implementation-coupled** — mocks internal collaborators, tests private methods, or verifies through a side channel (querying the database instead of using the interface). The tell: the test breaks when you refactor but behavior hasn't changed.
* **Tautological** — the assertion recomputes the expected value the way the code does (`expect(add(a, b)).toBe(a + b)`, a snapshot derived by hand the same way, a constant asserted equal to itself), so it passes by construction and can never disagree with the code. Expected values must come from an independent source of truth — a known-good literal, a worked example, the spec.
* **Horizontal slicing** — writing all tests first, then all implementation. Bulk tests verify *imagined* behavior: you test the *shape* of things rather than user-facing behavior, the tests go insensitive to real changes, and you commit to test structure before understanding the implementation. Work in **vertical slices** instead — one test → one implementation → repeat, each test a **tracer bullet** that responds to what the last cycle taught you.

## Rules of the loop

Before any pytest invocation in the red-green-refactor loop, follow the
mandatory test-service preflight in `AGENTS.md` and
`docs/process/testing-guide.md`. Determine the selected scope's complete
external prerequisites and verify them before pytest starts. Missing
prerequisites leave the test cycle unresolved.

* **Red before green.** Write the failing test first, then only enough code to pass it. Don't anticipate future tests or add speculative features.
* **One slice at a time.** One seam, one test, one minimal implementation per cycle.
* **Refactoring is not part of the loop.** It belongs to the review stage, not the red → green implementation cycle.
